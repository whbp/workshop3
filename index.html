            <p class="paragraph-12">With the progress of automated driving technologies, self-driving cars are driving
                safely on highways and freeways in most circumstances. However, the lack of safe and smooth interactions
                with pedestrians becomes one of the significant obstacles preventing fully autonomous vehicles in city
                streets. Protections of vulnerable road users like pedestrians are of the highest priority in traffic
                safety, and crashes with pedestrians will significantly impact the trust and public attitudes towards
                the new mobility technology. Disruptive interactions with pedestrians may also lower both the riding
                experiences and driving efficiency in the pedestrian-rich road environments. It is vital to understand
                pedestrians and make motion planning based on the predictions of their behaviors.<br /> <br />Besides
                pedestrian detection and tracking, many research efforts have been put into recognizing
                pedestrians&#x27; behaviors and predicting their trajectories in the past few years. The achievements
                can predict potential crashes and make motion-planning decisions accordingly in a longer duration. This
                Workshop will focus on the detection, recognition, and prediction of pedestrian behaviors for automated
                driving cars to interact with them smoothly. The goal is to build a platform for sharing
                state-of-the-art models, algorithms, and datasets in the field and identifying research needs and
                directions.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-13">The workshop will have three components to attract attendances. First, we will host
                a competition on pedestrian intention prediction based on a newly developed benchmark dataset. Winners
                of the competitions will be announced during and requested to attend the workshop. Winning teams will
                receive the prizes and introduce/demo the algorithms. The competition will be sponsored by the IEEE ITS
                society and organized by the TASI research center at IUPUI. There is no prior competition on this topic
                that has ever been done. Considering the importance of the topic, we believe that the competition and
                the workshop can attract good attentions.<br /><br />Second, several keynote speakers from the area of
                pedestrian behavior and intention prediction will be invited to talk about the progress and vision in
                the field. Distinguished researchers from industry and academia will be invited.<br /><br />Third,
                submissions to the workshop will be accepted. As a blooming field related to the critical algorithms for
                fully automated driving, pedestrian behavior and intention prediction algorithms are quickly increasing
                in numbers. Accepted submissions will have the opportunities to present the work in the workshop as
                well.</p>
